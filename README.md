# Resources for learning

## Challenge websites

These are places you can go to practice things when you know the basic idea, but you need some challenge. Like, you have a sword, but it isn't sharp, so you need to go and sharpen it! Hatori Hanzo 4 LIFE!

(Edabit)[https://edabit.com/] is good for grasping the basics

(Exercism)[https://exercism.org/] helps you get going with a new language

(CodeWars)[https://www.codewars.com/] some harder challenges but split into 8 levels and community driven (I like this one)

(Leet Code)[https://leetcode.com/] quite challenging, good for interview prep

(Project Euler)[https://projecteuler.net/] mathsy flavoured problems, fun and challenging
